# Using R and Python Together with Reticulate

R and Rstudio are great for workflows in statistics and data science, but what if you need to use a library that's only available in Python? What if your collaborators work in Python and you work primarily in R (or vice versa)? How might you share code and make it so your workflows come together? The `reticulate` package helps with these issues and can make bringing together R and Python a joy. 

Surely the folks at [RStudio](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) are the best source of information about this recent thrust in interoperability, however, after getting a feel for `reticulate` and how it might fit into my own workflow I'm happy to share a point of view about how to add this powerful tool to your own data science toolbox.

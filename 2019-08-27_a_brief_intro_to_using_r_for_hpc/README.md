# Abstract

While the R programming language was not developed for High Performance Computing (think about the ‘for’ loops!), thanks to its always thriving community of users, there are several ways in which R can be used to perform HPC. In this presentation, I will give you a general overview of HPC in R with a particular focus on multi-core processing (i.e. no big data for now), and introduce some of the available tools for enhancing your R code. The presentation will include some examples using the 'parallel' package,  Rcpp, and Rcpp(Armadillo) + OpenMP.

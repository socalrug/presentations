A quick look at homelessness figures

The Role Emergency Departments are designed to meet

How those don’t two things don’t always line up

A new role we created to tackle those issues

And how that’s going

## [Homelessness by the Numbers]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-   **United States** (\~pop. 331.5 million)

    -   580,466 People Experiencing Homelessness (PEH)

    -   0.175% of U.S. population

     

-   **California** (\~pop. 40 million)

    -   161,548 PEH

    -   0.408% of state population

    -   California makes up 11.9% of U.S. pop, but hosts 28% of all PEH in U.S.

I won’t drag you through all of these figures, but here are the highlights:

About 0.2% of the U.S. population was experiencing homelessness in 2020.

Post-COVID that number’s only gone up from the 580 thousand seen here.

Zooming in, 12 percent of Americans live in California

But 28 percent of all Americans experiencing homelessness live in the state

-   **LA City** (\~pop. 3.9 million)

    -   39% of county population but 62% of PEH

    -   2/3 in first episode of homelessness

Zooming in even further, Los Angeles County is home to 25% of California’s population

but 41% of Californians experiencing homelessness reside in the county.

2 of every 5 LA County residents is within the City of LA, 

but 3 of every 5 people experiencing homelessness in the county resides in city limits.

And COVID is expected to have left another 20,000 Angelenos homeless.

::: {.notes}
With the background of homelessness established, let’s look at what Emergency Departments are designed to do:

It’s a community safety net for anyone needing aid. 

EMTALA ensures that.

But emergency departments are designed as more or less a midway point in your care journey: 

The idea is that you get stabilized enough to go back home or to be admitted.

Recent decades have seen the ED model tested and challenged by growing non-urgent ED utilization.

The results? 

The ED’s resources get spread thin, 

everybody’s wait time balloons with the influx of patients, 

and people leave without even being seen because they’re tired of waiting.

:::

::: {.notes}
I’m not telling you anything new here. 

We’ve all seen overflowing waiting rooms and gurneys lining hallways.

Those non-urgent cases are part of the culprit

Folks are trying to get their prescriptions refilled at the ED

Poorly regulated blood pressure or blood sugar cases pack the waiting room

and for many behavioral health patients, stopping by the ED essentially becomes part of their social routine.

All through this, staff are getting spread thin, 

that drain on energy and burnout puts both staff and patients at risk.

And these issues all existed BEFORE COVID.
:::

## [Homeless Care at Cedars-Sinai ED]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   7,956 visits by 3,194 PEH patients Feb 2020-Jan 2021

-   Roughly 2.49 visits per PEH patient

-   Many there for basic needs

    -   Food

    -   Shelter

    -   Primary care-level treatment

::: {.notes}
One of the patient groups often behind those low-acuity cases are those experiencing homelessness

Here’s what the homeless caseload looked like in our ED: 

February 2020 to January 2021, our neighbors experiencing homelessness visited nearly 8,000 times. 

The average here suggests 2-3 times per patient, 

but some were seen dozens or even more than 100 times.

Common chief complaints we see in those visits are food needs, 

seeking shelter and treatment for issues best handled by a PCP or urgent care.

## [California SB1152]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   Passed in 2018, requires hospitals to document info about patients experiencing homelessness before discharging them.

    -   Services offered

        -   Transportation

        -   Meal

        -   Meds

        -   Vaccinations

        -   Weather-appropriate clothing

    -   Resources offered

        -   Clinical/Behavioral

        -   Follow-up with PCP

        -   Help getting health coverage

::: {.notes}
Rewind a little bit before COVID, 

California passed a law requiring hospitals to document the types of services and resources offered to patients experiencing homelessness before discharging them

Were they fed?

Did they get a ride to where they stay?

How about meds? Vaccinations? Help applying for insurance?

Were their clothes appropriate for the conditions outside?

Were they set up with a follow-up appointment with a PCP or behaviorist?

All these must be noted before discharge according to California law.

:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Obviously the status quo wasn’t meeting our homeless patients’ needs.

ED leadership started wondering if there was something being missed in the initial encounter 

that could limit the need for return visits. 

And somebody was going to need to track those new data points.

A generous donor was able to help the ED create a new role, 

the Community Resource Coordinator was charged with going beyond the symptoms with our patients experiencing homelessness.

If patients welcome a CRC’s help, the CRC works on connecting them with vital staple needs, or shelter, or health coverage, or follow-up 
care.

By the way, this is Weihao, who was one of our OG CRCs. 

A lot of the target variables you’re about to see are his brainchild. I just crunched them.
:::

## [How's It Going?]{style="font-weight:500"}

Are CRCs effective at reducing the use of emergency services for non-urgent matters while ensuring that homeless patients can access their basic needs?

 

Data gathered in fulfilling SB1152 needs used to measure role's impact

::: {.notes}
So let’s tackle this like a research question: 

Are CRCs effective at reducing the use of emergency services for non-urgent matters while ensuring that homeless patients can access their basic needs?

Luckily, we’ve got a dataset to help us figure it out.
:::

## [Studying the Impact]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   Diff-in-diff cohort model

    -   Visit rates of patients experiencing homelessness

    -   Split by whether they were seen by a CRC during their index visit

-   Dependent variables

    -   Time interval between visits (in days)

    -   Cost of stay

    -   Length of stay (LOS)

-   Differences in the populations were tested for statistical significance using a Welch's t-test

::: {.notes}
Nerd goggles on.

We tested a diff-in-diff cohort model 

to compare the visit rate of patients experiencing homelessness. 

One group saw a CRC at their index visit, 

one group didn’t see a CRC on that visit.

Across groups we compared how long it took a patient to return to the ED, the cost of their stay, and the length of their stay and ran 
each through a t-test.
:::

## [What We Found]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   A two-sample t-test demonstrated statistical significance (p = 0.0014)

-   22.82% increase to \# of days elapsed before a patient returned to the ED after visiting with a CRC

-   95% confidence interval: 2.6-10.9 days larger gap between ED visits
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/overallGap.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
When it came to gap between return visits, we indeed found statistical significance. 

Patients who saw a CRC took an extra 3-11 days to return compared with those who didn’t.

:::

## [Other Results]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Difference in cost of care

    -   p = 0.1050

    -   Not statistically significant

-   Difference in length of stay in the ED

    -   p = 0.1053

    -   Not statistically significant

-   Makes sense considering CRC can't really affect those figures
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/scott.png){fig-align="right"}
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Those differences for cost and length of stay didn’t quite work out. 

We couldn’t achieve statistical significance there, 

but upon reflection that made sense. 

A CRC doesn’t have any sway in what treatment you receive in the ED or when.
:::

## [Understanding the Results]{style="font-weight:500"} {.smaller}

-   Increased gap between ED visits

-   Lowered rate of ED visits over 90 and 180 days

-   Implications

    -   Increased utilization of community resources may be decreasing frequency of needs that draw patients experiencing homelessness to ED

    -   Reduced burden by lower-urgency needs on ED resources

-   Possible effects

    -   Shorter wait times

    -   Fewer patients leaving without being seen

    -   Greater focus on other patients with more acute needs

::: {.notes}
So yay, we got a few p-values to go our way. But what does that mean?

The big win comes in the fact we know these patients are getting connected to the community resources they need. 

They’re getting opportunities at follow-up care that goes beyond the symptoms.

Meanwhile, in the ED, the possible gains are cuts in wait time, 

fewer patients heading for the door before being seen, 

and emergency providers getting to do more of what they entered the field to do: Save lives in immediate danger
